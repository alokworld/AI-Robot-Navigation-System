# Overview
The AI Robot Navigation System is a project designed to enable intelligent navigation for robots, allowing them to traverse from an initial state to a specified goal state. This system employs an efficient combination of an SQLite database for storing the map of the search space, uninformed search algorithms, and the Matplotlib library for visualizing the search space and paths.

#Features
SQLite Database Integration: The system utilizes an SQLite database to store the map of the search space. This ensures a structured and organized representation of the environment, facilitating efficient navigation.

Uninformed Search Algorithm: The project incorporates uninformed search algorithms to find paths from the initial state to the goal state. These algorithms make decisions based solely on the information available, making them suitable for various scenarios.

Matplotlib Visualization: The search space, as well as the discovered paths, can be visually represented using the Matplotlib library. This provides users with a clear and intuitive understanding of the robot's navigation process.

#How It Works
#Database Setup: 
The search space is defined and stored in an SQLite database, providing a comprehensive representation of the environment.

#Uninformed Search: 
The system employs uninformed search algorithms to explore the search space systematically, finding paths from the initial state to the goal state.

#Path Visualization: 
Matplotlib is used to visualize the search space and display the discovered paths, making it easier for users to interpret and analyze the robot's navigation.
